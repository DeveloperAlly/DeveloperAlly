Coming from a strong background in technology consultancy, research & development I have scoped and delivered projects of all sizes, budgets and timelines. I'm also experienced in hands-on small business and startup operations, and in applying technology to solve real world business and societal problems by building scalable and feasible solutions.
I previously owned and operated a successful café before going on to complete degrees in Mechtronics Engineering and Computer Science in 2017.
Whilst studying, I co-founded a startup after winning a hackathon and worked through the iAccelarate business incubator to build out our solution. 
Throughout my studies, I worked as a freelance developer building websites and mobile applications (react + react-native/android) for clients and managing requirements and needs.
I have since worked on enterprise-level technologies at Accenture Australia, primarily focused on full stack development, deployment and integration of our teams flagship AIOps product to high value clients and Fortune 500 companies.
I also worked to develop the software for a novel ML and IOT surveillance system  in a joint collaboration between the Defence Department and University of Sydney Physics Department
